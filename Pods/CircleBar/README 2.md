Don’t you, sometimes, miss fun user interfaces?  
Truth is, we do. Sure, you can't use them in enterprise apps for obvious reasons, but if you're working on a fun project... 

CircleBar is a fun tab bar navigation controller,  
written in Swift 4 and available through CocoaPods. 

> Currently at v1.0. Contributions are welcome.
